Known problems:

1.

When compiled with g++-mp-4.6 from ports, linking against static
Boost libraries compiled with llvm results in the following error:

sup(38484) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fff7f191860: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
Abort trap: 6


Workaround:
Build Boost static libraries with gcc-mp-4.6

2.
Replace boost::threadpool with io_service and packaged_task
